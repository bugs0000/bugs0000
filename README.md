- 👋 Hi, I’m bugs
- 👀 I’m learning to code and develop software, start to finish, ready for final deployment when it leaves my hard drive.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning hashing/cryptogrphy, Github?, javascript, C, Solidity, assembly languages, Python and some html/css stuff.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything that isn't a shameless cash grab. Was in communication with some of the Freyala team to get to working on that project but that's not set n stone yet.  
- 📫 How to reach me? Easy. Message me here or email me at bugshavefeelerstoo@gmail.com. I also have discord and telegram, message me for those handles.
- 🧠 I know how to use GameMaker and GML to create basic computer games and software. I also have experience with electrical engineering, circuit design and analysis, microprocessor archetecture, embedded systems, creating websites, programming QoL macros for myself, and building 3D printers as well as the firmware and hardware involved with that.

Thanks for reading my super interesting about me page. I'm looking for something to work on! Feel free to get in touch if you've got a project that needs an extra hand. 

Bear with me I am new to most of this Github culture.
