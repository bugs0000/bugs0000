- 👋 Hi, I’m @bugs0000
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code and develop software, start to finish, ready for final deployment when it leaves my hard drive.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Solidity, Javascript, C, assembly languages, and some cryptography.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything that isn't a shameless cash grab. 
- 📫 How to reach me? Easy. Message me here or email me at bugshavefeelerstoo@gmail.com. I also have discord and telegram, message me for those handles.
